# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project

This is a blank project for CDK development with TypeScript.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.


## Useful commands

* `pnpm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `pnpm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `pnpm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `pnpm cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `pnpm cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `pnpm cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
* `pnpm cdk-app`   runs infrastructure.ts (through ts-node, so no build necessary)

## HOWTO: USE CREDENTIALS
